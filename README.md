**Course Description**

A typical organization loses an estimated 5% of its yearly revenue to fraud. In this course, learn to fight fraud by using data. Apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud, and use unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. 

Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to the norm.  As such, learn to properly classify imbalanced datasets.

The course provides technical and theoretical insights and demonstrates how to implement fraud detection models. Finally, get tips and advice from real-life experience to help prevent common mistakes in fraud analytics.
